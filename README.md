The psychic game is a randomized guessing game pitting the computer user versus the computer.

The game starts when you the computer user selects a letter. The user will be given 9 chances to guess the correct letter.

On every guess the computer chooses another letter

On every correct guess, the user will be alerted "Nice job!" and the remaining guesses will be reset back to 9. The user will be able to see the correct answer in "Your Guesses So Far:"

On every incorrect guess, the users remaining guesses will decrement until the number is 0. Upon the final incorrect guess the user will be alerted "Game over" and the remaining guesses will reset back to 9.

The wins and losses will increment until the page is refreshed.
